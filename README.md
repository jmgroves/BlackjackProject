## Blackjack Project

### Overview
this is a blackjack simulator.

### Topics
* Object-oriented design
* interfaces
* Enums
* Inheritance and Abstraction
* Java Collections


## How to run
* Written in java, import the project into an IDE of your choice. Run BlackJackApp with the main method.

* I have been working towards separating methods and encapsulation whenever possible. I have definitely noticed my code is easier to read after stepping way as well as easier to debug.
